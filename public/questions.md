### 1. So, what's your (favourite) editor/IDE story?
I've tried a lot of editors or IDEs and I'm still trying :)
I've tried vim again and again, but the settings didn't work, that's why I work with an IDE / editor.
I am currently using Webstrom at company and privately I use VS Code

### 2. Favourite plugin with it and what's so superb about it?
I like to work with Prettier plugin in VS Code and Webstrom for formatting the code.
The clean code is very important to me and Prettier helps me with it.

There are also various plugins that I use again and again such as ESLint, GitLens, CSS in JS, Live Server, Markdown Preview, PlantUML, Simple React Snippets, Test Explorer for Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio IntelliCode, and even more ...

The plugins are all for VS Code, and in Webstrom is everything already available. :)
